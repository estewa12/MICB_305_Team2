305 Team Meeting #5 Agenda - 3:00PM Monday February 8th, 2026


Meeting Objectives:
* No statistical difference between farm living and age of onset
* Delegate out who's doing what for assignment 2
* Discuss how to navigate Github (our repository) - making folders etc 
   * How to organize our repository and what files to include




Meeting Notes: 
* No optional meeting over reading break
* No statistical difference between farm living and age of onset → not a big deal, we will also compare to the microbiome composition 
   * Microbiome data = zero inflated data 
   * Bunch of different taxa where counts for some samples = 0 
      * A lot of stat tests try to fit data so it works
* Include the feature and taxonomy tables in the Assignment 5 submission
* Microbiome analyses:
   * Most are taxonomic based: presence/abundance of microbial species
   * Picrust: we know certain taxa have certain metabolic functions, use taxonomic identity to predict metabolic potential 


Assignment 2: 
* We are not expected to run all analyses listed on the assignment 
* Different analytical steps to try and answer the research question
   * Expecting to have between 2-4 research aims 
      * Big research question: farm living affecting microbiome associated with PD onset 
   * Break down big RQ into achievable aims 
      * Aim: builds on itself 
      * Aim 1: does farm living affect alpha beta microbiome diversity 
      * Aim 2: are there microbes associated with farm living (differential abundance)
      * Aim 3: predicted functional changes in the microbiome (picrust) 
      * Aim 4: we have identified differentially different microbes can we take these markers and predict age of onset. 
      * Look at UJEMI PAPERS
   * What info can we get from each different analysis and how can it address some of the aims?


Each come up with an aim and then figure out which data analyses for each aim?
* Keep in mind potential figures we can generate from each analyses and how this would fit into our paper.
NO DEFAULT R COLOURS


Suggestions for GitHub
* How do we organize it to make a new folder for notes and agendas
* Use backslash to create folders on Github 
   * Emma created a Markdown file for readability (thank you Emma!)
