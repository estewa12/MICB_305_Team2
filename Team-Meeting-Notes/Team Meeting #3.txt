305 Team Meeting #3 Agenda - 3:00PM Monday January 26th, 2026


Meeting Objectives:
* Confirm delegation of tasks for group assignment 1


Group Assignment 1:
* Part 1B - where can I find how they classified “farm living”
   * Is it a certain amount of time (ex. 1 year)?
   * Avril mentioned there were people adding comments about this when the data was collected, but I can’t seem to find them in the article or supplemental material.
* Part 1B - how are we defining the microbial composition for this project? 
   * Are we looking at individual microbes present?
   * Differences in diversity?
   * Lack of certain common species of microbes?
   * Data analysis - how to perform 




Meeting Minutes:


Farm living - categorical yes/no, not much more info in metadata but Claire will follow up with Avril to ask


For the research questions: Using specific microbes as markers


Part 1 of question: does farm living in PD alter microbiota comp? (find farm living associated microbes) 


Part 2: are these farm associated microbes (microbial families/genera) correlated with PD age of onset?


Before next meeting: 
Figure out how many controls you have if u subset them by groups


How to train your own classifier?   
Need to find in paper– 
In methods- microbiome sequencing and analysis 
The bacterial 16S was ampliiffed using —----primers 
Look in table S1
