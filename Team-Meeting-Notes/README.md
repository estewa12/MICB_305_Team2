This folder contains links to weekly Google Docs for team meetings as well as meeting minutes.

To find agenda for upcoming week, follow the link to the Google Doc and find tab corresponding to that week. Keeping agendas in Google Docs allows for collaboration between team members to edit and add to agendas.

Meeting minutes from each week will be uploaded to GitHub after the meeting. They can also be found in the Google Doc, but will be uploaded here for easier navigation.
